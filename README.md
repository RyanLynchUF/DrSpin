# Background
One of my favorite quotes is:

"When you are a pessimist and the bad thing happens, you live it twice. Once when you worry about it, and the second time when it happens” – Amos Tversky

It reinforces a principle I think can help improve anyone's life: the power of positive thinking. I don't prescribe to this mantra in the light of a preachy, self-help book, but rather look at it as a method for dealing with an objective reality.

Often, the negative news or outcomes that can make someone feel down are either (1) an event that has already occurred (or will inevitability occur) and can't be changed or (2) is an event that may come, but can be altered through action. In both of these situations, a negative viewpoint won't do anything except make the path forward more difficult. A positive perspective can help you see negative news in a different light, and inspire an impactful change moving forward.

Applying this frame of mind is difficult. For some reason, we (as humans) are inclined to be more driven to negative news (and news media companies are aware of this). So, I created Dr. Spin to help me put a positive spin on life.
